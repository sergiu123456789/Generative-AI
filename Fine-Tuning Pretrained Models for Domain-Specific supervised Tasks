# Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models for Domain-Specific Tasks

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning pretrained language models to tailor them for specific domain tasks, thereby improving their performance and relevance. The process involves leveraging efficient fine-tuning methods, using appropriate tools for supervised tasks, preparing the dataset correctly, and evaluating model performance using well-established metrics.

---

## Objectives

- Fine-tune pretrained models for domain-specific classification tasks.
- Gain insights into **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to enable efficient fine-tuning with fewer resources.
- Utilize **Transformers Reinforcement Learning (TRL)** and **SFTTrainer** for supervised fine-tuning.
- Properly format and preprocess datasets for compatibility with the fine-tuning pipeline.
- Evaluate model effectiveness using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score  
  (All calculated using the `scikit-learn` library.)

## Tools & Libraries

- 🤗 **Transformers**
- 🧵 **TRL** (`transformers` + `trl` integration)
- 🦙 **LoRA** (via `peft` or `trl`)
- 🧪 **Scikit-learn** (for evaluation metrics)
- 🐍 **Python** (>=3.8)
- 📊 **Pandas**, **NumPy** (for data handling)

## Workflow

### 1. Dataset Preparation

- Ensure the dataset is in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- Include clearly labeled inputs and targets for supervised learning.
- Tokenize using the tokenizer of the base pretrained model.
- Create `Dataset` and `DataLoader` objects as needed.

### 2. Fine-Tuning with LoRA

- Apply LoRA to reduce GPU memory usage and training time.
- Inject LoRA modules into attention layers of the model.
- Configure LoRA parameters like rank, alpha, and dropout.

### 3. Supervised Fine-Tuning with TRL

- Use `SFTTrainer` from the TRL library.
- Define training arguments (e.g., epochs, batch size, learning rate).
- Provide model, tokenizer, dataset, and evaluation strategy.

### 4. Evaluation with Scikit-learn

After fine-tuning, evaluate the model using:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
