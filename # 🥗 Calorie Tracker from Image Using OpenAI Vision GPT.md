# ðŸ¥— Calorie Tracker from Image Using OpenAI Vision GPT

Built an AI-powered calorie tracker that estimates calories from a food image using OpenAI's Vision GPT model.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API
- Python
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- REST API requests
- Calorie database API (e.g., CalorieNinjas)

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Upload or capture food images for analysis
- Use GPT-4 Vision to identify food items in images
- Map identified items to estimated calorie values
- Provide detailed calorie breakdowns for meals

## ðŸ§ª Process

1. **Image Processing** â€“ Received and prepared images for API submission  
2. **Vision Analysis** â€“ Used GPT-4 Vision to describe food contents in the image  
3. **Calorie Mapping** â€“ Matched identified foods to calorie estimates via external APIs or databases  
4. **Result Presentation** â€“ Displayed calorie counts and itemized breakdowns to the user

## âœ… Results
- Enabled easy calorie estimation from photos without manual input  
- Combined computer vision with language understanding for multimodal AI  
- Demonstrated potential for health and fitness applications

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Improve food recognition accuracy with custom training  
- Add nutritional breakdown (macros, vitamins)  
- Develop mobile app for on-the-go calorie tracking
